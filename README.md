# Application Pitch

Name: Plateful

Motivation: Choosing what to order at a restaurant should feel exciting, not stressful. But for many people, itâ€™s a source of anxiety. Do you stick with a safe option, try the most popular dish, or gamble on something completely new? The pressure only grows when dining with friends, on a date, or when trying a new cuisine for the first time. Take away the guesswork so you can focus on enjoying your meal and making your dining experience more fun and stress-free!

Key Features:

Personalized Recommendations: When you search a restaurant, the app suggests a dish curated for you. Over time, as you mark what you liked or disliked, recommendations grow smarter and more tailored to your unique tastes. This reduces stress by helping you explore new foods, while making sure that every order feels like a safe but exciting choice. Now, customers are more likely to try new dishes, turning every meal into a positive experience.

User History: See past recommended meals and how you rated them!

## Recommended Browser Setup

- Chromium-based browsers (Chrome, Edge, Brave, etc.):
  - [Vue.js devtools](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/vuejs-devtools/nhdogjmejiglipccpnnnanhbledajbpd) 
  - [Turn on Custom Object Formatter in Chrome DevTools](http://bit.ly/object-formatters)

## Type Support for `.vue` Imports in TS

TypeScript cannot handle type information for `.vue` imports by default, so we replace the `tsc` CLI with `vue-tsc` for type checking. In editors, we need [Volar](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Vue.volar) to make the TypeScript language service aware of `.vue` types.

## Customize configuration

See [Vite Configuration Reference](https://vite.dev/config/).

## Project Setup

```sh
npm install
```

### Compile and Hot-Reload for Development

```sh
npm run dev

### Type-Check, Compile and Minify for Production

```sh
npm run build
```

### Run Unit Tests with [Vitest](https://vitest.dev/)

```sh
npm run test:unit
```

### Run End-to-End Tests with [Playwright](https://playwright.dev)

```sh
# Install browsers for the first run
npx playwright install
