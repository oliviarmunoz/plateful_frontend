## Application Pitch

Name: Plateful

Motivation: Choosing what to order at a restaurant should feel exciting, not stressful. But for many people, itâ€™s a source of anxiety. Do you stick with a safe option, try the most popular dish, or gamble on something completely new? The pressure only grows when dining with friends, on a date, or when trying a new cuisine for the first time. Take away the guesswork so you can focus on enjoying your meal and making your dining experience more fun and stress-free!

Key Features:

Personalized Recommendations: When you search a restaurant, the app suggests a dish curated for you. Over time, as you mark what you liked or disliked, recommendations grow smarter and more tailored to your unique tastes. This reduces stress by helping you explore new foods, while making sure that every order feels like a safe but exciting choice. Now, customers are more likely to try new dishes, turning every meal into a positive experience.
