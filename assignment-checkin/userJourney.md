# User Journey

A user has been using Plateful for a few days now and wants help deciding what to eat for dinner today. They are typically not very picky, but they haven't liked many dishes with peanuts. They login to the website, navigate to the Home page, and type in the name of a nearby restaurant. Selecting from the dropdown, they click on the name of the restaurant.

The app pulls the restaurant’s menu and runs the recommendation process: it considers the menu dishes, applies the user’s preferences, and suggests a peanut-free noodle bowl. Relieved they don’t have to scan the entire menu, the user heads to the restaurant. After their meal, the user indicates that they liked the recommendation, rating it 5 stars, and adding it to their liked dishes. Afterwards, the user is interested in looking at their past reviews, so they navigate to their profile and see their past liked and disliked dishes as well as their ratings.

Later, the user visits a different restaurant, doing the same process as before. The app again filters the menu according to the updated preferences and recommends a spicy ramen. The user enjoys their meal and feels that the app understands their tastes better over time.
