# User Journey

A user has been using Plateful for a few days now and wants help deciding what to eat for dinner today. They are typically not very picky, but they haven't liked many dishes with peanuts. They login to the website, navigate to the Home page, and type in the name of a nearby restaurant.

The app pulls the restaurant’s menu and runs the recommendation process: it considers the menu dishes, applies the user’s preferences, and suggests a peanut-free noodle bowl. Relieved they don’t have to scan the entire menu, the user heads to the restaurant. After their meal, the user indicates if they liked the recommendation, rating it 5 stars, and adds it to their liked dishes.

Later, the user visits a different restaurant. The app again filters the menu according to the updated preferences and recommends a spicy ramen. The user enjoys their meal and feels that the app understands their tastes better over time.
